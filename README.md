# COVID-19 Dashboard

After undertaking an intensive introduction to Python programming, I was given the task of creating a dashboard for data analysis purposes.

The following dashboard visualizes COVID-19 [data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) published by [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england).

To ensure new data is being fetched using the API, the data in the attached JSON files is intentionally outdated.

Initially, the outdated data will be graphed. Once a user refreshes the data, the new data will be graphed. 

## Important:

The contents of this repository will only be made public after 16:00 on Friday, 2 December, 2022.

The "Launch Binder" link below will not work until the repository is set to "Public".
